# Description
Following tutorial from [Python Programming](https://pythonprogramming.net/loading-images-python-opencv-tutorial/) to work with image recognition using OpenCV.


# Implementation Ideas
How can we use a regular video stream and add the power of Artificial Inteligence behind it to work as a multi-mode counter?

We could have a camera located at intersections or specific trails to keep track on the amount of:
+ Cars
+ Bikes
+ Pedestrians
+ Wheelchair
+ Trucks

Capturing the following for future ML implementation:
+ count (of mode)
+ datetime
+ direction of movement
