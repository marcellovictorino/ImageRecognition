This is a project to learn some Machine Learning, working with image recognition.

How can we use a regular video stream and add the power of Artificial Inteligency behind it to work as a multi-mode counter.

We could have a camera located at intersections or specific trails to keep track on the amount of:
+ Cars
+ Bikes
+ Pedestrians
+ Wheelchair
+ Trucks
